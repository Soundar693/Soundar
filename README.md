# Hi there! 👋 I'm Soundarraj

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate **Data Analyst** and aspiring **Product Analyst**, with a keen interest in uncovering actionable insights through data. Here's a glimpse of what I do:

## 🚀 About Me
- 🌟 Proficient in tools and technologies like **SQL**, **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**, and **Google BigQuery**. Yes, I talk to databases more than I talk to people. It's a very fulfilling relationship—no arguments, just queries.
- 📊 Skilled in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Probability**, **Statistical Analysis**, and **Data Visualization**. Basically, I stare at numbers until they make sense. Some might call it magic, I call it "debugging life."
- 🏋️ Experience working with datasets in domains like **Fitness Equipment**, **Streaming Platforms**, and **Micromobility**. Because who doesn’t love crunching data about treadmills while sitting? Exercise for the brain, if not the body.
- 🎯 Passionate about solving business problems with data-driven solutions. (Translation: I enjoy fixing things people didn’t know were broken—and getting all the credit.)

## 💼 Projects

### 1. **Target Sales Analysis**  
   - **Tools:** SQL, Google BigQuery  
   - **Highlights:** Analyzed sales data to derive key business insights, utilizing CTEs, window functions, and advanced SQL techniques. Visualized trends to recommend strategies for revenue growth. Spoiler alert: Selling more things leads to more money. Groundbreaking, I know.

### 2. **Aerofit Customer Analysis**  
   - **Skills:** Probability, EDA, Data Visualization  
   - **Highlights:** Identified customer characteristics for treadmill products, enabling personalized recommendations. Conducted statistical analysis and constructed contingency tables to uncover insights. Turns out, not everyone wants the same treadmill—who knew? I’m still waiting for the customizable treadmill.

### 3. **Global Streaming Platform Analysis**  
   - **Skills:** EDA, Data Cleaning, Multivariate Analysis  
   - **Highlights:** Analyzed user engagement metrics and retention rates. Delivered actionable insights to enhance content strategies. Because binge-watching needs science too. Someone has to justify all those midnight marathons.

### 4. **Yulu Micromobility Analysis**  
   - **Skills:** Hypothesis Testing, Probability, EDA  
   - **Highlights:** Conducted hypothesis testing to validate assumptions. Analyzed trip data to optimize user experience and fleet management. Finding out why your last ride was slower than a walk. (Hint: It’s probably the hills—or gravity.)

## 📚 Learning & Growth
- 🌱 Currently exploring **advanced data visualization tools** and **A/B testing methodologies**. Still figuring out why bar charts get all the love. Pie charts deserve a comeback—fight me.
- 🔍 Actively contributing to projects that merge **business insights** with **data analysis**. Translating business jargon into pretty graphs. Sometimes the graphs are prettier than the insights.

## 🏆 Achievements
- **Certification:** Python for Data Analysis (Scalar, taught by Akash Rajpuria)  
- Completed 4+ real-world projects aligned with **business analytics** and **product analysis**. I’m certified to wrangle data, not snakes—though I hear data bites sometimes.
